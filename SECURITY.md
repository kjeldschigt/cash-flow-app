# 🔐 Security Guidelines

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

**If you have cloned this repository, IMMEDIATELY follow these steps:**

### 1. Generate New API Keys

The following API keys may have been compromised and should be regenerated:

#### Stripe (Payment Processing)
1. Log into your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Go to **Developers** → **API Keys**
3. **Delete** any existing keys
4. **Create new** Publishable and Secret keys
5. Update your `.env` file with the new keys

#### Airtable (Data Integration)
1. Log into your [Airtable Account](https://airtable.com/account)
2. Go to **Account** → **Generate API Key**
3. **Revoke** any existing API keys
4. **Generate** a new API key
5. Update your `.env` file with the new key

### 2. Secure Your Environment

```bash
# Generate a secure encryption key
python -c "import secrets; print('ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Generate a secure secret key
python -c "import secrets; print('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` with your actual values:**
   - Never use placeholder values in production
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Generate secure random keys

3. **Verify `.env` is gitignored:**
   ```bash
   git check-ignore .env  # Should return: .env
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- ✅ Use `.env.example` for templates only
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files to version control
- ✅ Use different keys for development/staging/production
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets in source code
- ❌ Never share `.env` files via email/chat

### Database Security
- ✅ Database files are automatically gitignored
- ✅ Use encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ Regular backups with encryption
- ❌ Never commit database files
- ❌ Never store plaintext passwords

### API Key Management
- ✅ Use environment-specific keys
- ✅ Implement key rotation policies
- ✅ Monitor API key usage
- ❌ Never expose keys in client-side code
- ❌ Never log API keys

### Production Deployment
- ✅ Use secure environment variable injection
- ✅ Enable HTTPS/TLS encryption
- ✅ Implement proper authentication
- ✅ Regular security audits
- ❌ Never use development keys in production

## 🚨 Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediately revoke all API keys**
2. **Change all passwords and secrets**
3. **Review access logs**
4. **Update all environment configurations**
5. **Notify relevant stakeholders**

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] All sensitive files are gitignored
- [ ] New API keys generated and configured
- [ ] Strong encryption keys in place
- [ ] Database files excluded from version control
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for production
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms tested
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Regular backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

Monitor these indicators:
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unexpected database access
- Suspicious file access patterns
- Abnormal network traffic
